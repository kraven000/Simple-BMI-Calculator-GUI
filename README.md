**BMI Calculator using Tkinter**

This Python script provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) using the Tkinter library. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.

### Requirements:
- Python 3. x
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### How to Use:
1. Run the script.
2. Input your height in meters in the provided entry box.
3. Input your weight in kilograms in the provided entry box.
4. Click the "SUBMIT!!!" button to calculate your BMI.
5. A message box will display your BMI along with its classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).
6. Click "Exit!!" to close the application.

### Files:
- `main.py`: The main Python script containing the BMI calculator code.
- `icon.png`: Icon file for the application window (replace with your desired icon).

### How It Works:
- The script takes input for height and weight.
- On clicking the "SUBMIT!!!" button, it calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2.
- It then classifies the BMI: Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.
- The result is displayed in a message box.
- Error handling is implemented to handle incorrect inputs or exceptions.

### GUI Components:
- Two input fields for height and weight.
- "SUBMIT!!!" button to trigger the BMI calculation.
- "Exit!!" button to close the application.
- A clean and simple interface for easy interaction.

### Note:
- Ensure input height in meters and weight in kilograms for accurate results.
- This application is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.
